    <p class="i">Son Goku, born Kakarot (kakarotto), is the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. Goku is a <em>Saiyan male originally sent to destroy Earth as an infant</em>. A head injury at an early age alters his memory, ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders.
